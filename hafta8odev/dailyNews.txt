Başlık: Google's New Restore Credentials Tool Simplifies App Login After Android Migration
Tarih: Nov 25, 2024
Açıklama: Google has introduced a new feature called Restore Credentials  to help users restore their account access to third-party apps securely after migrating to a new Android device.  Part of Android's Credential Manager API , the feature aims to reduce the hassle of re-entering the login credentials for every app during the handset replacement.  "With Restore Credentials, apps can seamlessly onboard users to their accounts on a new device after they restore their apps and data from their previous device," Google's Neelansh Sahai said .  The tech giant said the process occurs automatically in the background when a user restores apps and data from a previous device, enabling apps to sign users back into the respective accounts without requiring any additional interaction.   This is accomplished by means of what's called a restore key, which, in reality, is a public key that's compatible with FIDO2 standards such as passkeys.  Thus when a user signs in to an app that


Başlık: Beyond Compliance: The Advantage of Year-Round Network Pen Testing
Tarih: Nov 18, 2024
Açıklama: IT leaders know the drill—regulators and cyber insurers demand regular network penetration testing to keep the bad guys out. But here's the thing: hackers don't wait around for compliance schedules. Most companies approach network penetration testing on a set schedule, with the most common frequency being twice a year (29%), followed by three to four times per year (23%) and once per year (20%), according to the Kaseya Cybersecurity Survey Report 2024 . Compliance-focused testing can catch vulnerabilities that exist at the exact time of testing, but it's not enough to stay ahead of attackers in a meaningful way. Why More Frequent Testing Makes Sense When companies test more often, they're not just checking a box for compliance—they're actually protecting their networks. The Kaseya survey also points out that the top drivers for network penetration testing are: Cybersecurity Control and Validation (34%) – ensuring the security controls work and vulnerabilities are minimized.

Başlık: PyPI Python Library "aiocpa" Found Exfiltrating Crypto Keys via Telegram Bot
Tarih: Nov 25, 2024
Açıklama: The administrators of the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository have quarantined the package " aiocpa " following a new update that included malicious code to exfiltrate private keys via Telegram.  The package in question is described  as a synchronous and asynchronous Crypto Pay API  client. The package, originally released in September 2024, has been downloaded 12,100 times  to date.  By putting the Python library in quarantine, it prevents further installation by clients and cannot be modified by its maintainers.   Cybersecurity outfit Phylum, which shared  details of the software supply chain attack last week, said the author of the package published the malicious update to PyPI, while keeping the library's GitHub repository  clean in an attempt to evade detection.   It's currently not clear if the original developer was behind the rogue update or if their credentials were compromised by a different threat actor.  Signs of malicious activity were first spotted i

Başlık: Flying Under the Radar - Security Evasion Techniques
Tarih: Nov 25, 2024
Açıklama: Dive into the evolution of phishing and malware evasion techniques and understand how attackers are using increasingly sophisticated methods to bypass security measures.  The Evolution of Phishing Attacks  "I really like the saying that 'This is out of scope' said no hacker ever. Whether it's tricks, techniques or technologies, hackers will do anything to evade detection and make sure their attack is successful,"  says Etay Maor, Chief Security Strategist at Cato Networks and member of Cato CTRL . Phishing attacks have transformed significantly over the years. 15-20 years ago, simple phishing sites were sufficient for capturing the crown jewels of the time - credit card details. Today, attacks and defense methods have become much more sophisticated, as we'll detail below.  "This is also the time where the "cat-and-mouse" attack-defense game began,"  says Tal Darsan, Security Manager and member of Cato CTRL. At the time, a major defense technique against credit card phishing sites inv


Başlık: Cybersecurity Blind Spots in IaC and PaC Tools Expose Cloud Platforms to New Attacks
Tarih: Nov 25, 2024
Açıklama: Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed two new attack techniques against infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and policy-as-code (PaC) tools like HashiCorp's Terraform and Styra's Open Policy Agent (OPA) that leverage dedicated, domain-specific languages (DSLs) to breach cloud platforms and exfiltrate data.  "Since these are hardened languages with limited capabilities, they're supposed to be more secure than standard programming languages – and indeed they are," Tenable senior security researcher Shelly Raban said  in a technical report published last week. "However, more secure does not mean bulletproof."  OPA is a popular, open-source policy engine that allows organizations to enforce policies across cloud-native environments, such as microservices, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes. Policies are defined using a native query language called Rego  which are then evaluated  by OPA to return a decision.   The attack method devised by Tenable targets the supply


Başlık: Researchers Uncover Malware Using BYOVD to Bypass Antivirus Protections
Tarih: Nov 25, 2024
Açıklama: Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new malicious campaign that leverages a technique called Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver ( BYOVD ) to disarm security protections and ultimately gain access to the infected system.  "This malware takes a more sinister route: it drops a legitimate Avast Anti-Rootkit driver (aswArPot.sys) and manipulates it to carry out its destructive agenda," Trellix security researcher Trishaan Kalra said  in an analysis published last week.  "The malware exploits the deep access provided by the driver to terminate security processes, disable protective software, and seize control of the infected system."  The starting point of the attack is an executable file (kill-floor.exe) that drops the legitimate Avast Anti-Rootkit driver, which is subsequently registered as a service using Service Control (sc.exe) to perform its malicious actions.   Once the driver is up and running, the malware gains kernel-level access to the system, allowing it
